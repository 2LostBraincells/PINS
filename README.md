# Personal Identity Number Validator

A hyper optimized program for validating Personal Identity Numbers (or pinv for short)

## Usage

### Building
To build the project make sure cargo and xcrun are installed then run these commands
```
cd src
./cbrun
```

This will compile the compute shader and main program. It will then run the program.
The compiled executable can then be found in `target/release/build` under the name `pinv`

To run the program you can either use the `./run` command in the src folder, or find the executable in `target/release/build` under the name `pinv`
